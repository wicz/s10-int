* Subject it the title of the doc. Its base64 is used as filename. If sender 
changes the title, a new doc is created. The system must treat replies.

* The first line of the body of the email must be a command. Commands must
follow the format :<cmd>, e.g. :new, :list. All the following content is
treated as document content. The sender may end the body content with
a line containing the command :end. To avoid, for instance, signatures
and replies being part of the document

* Main parts: Reader, Parser, Backend and Responder

* Reader can read emails from files, stdin, imap, pop, etc.

* Parser parses the message, validates it format and return the
normalized command (and options). Exception is thrown if invalid.

* Backend does the heavy lifting. It executes the command and return
the response. Exception is thrown if command not found.

* Responder is responsible for all outgoing emails to communicate 
with end users. Exceptions are rescued and sent as well.
